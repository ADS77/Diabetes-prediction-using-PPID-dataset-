# Diabetes prediction using PPID dataset 

The  experiment  was done  with  a  dataset  collected  from  the  UCI  machine  learning repository  having  768  patients  and  8  numeric  features  of  each.Best features were selected using genetic algorithm (GA). k-foldcross-validation  was  used  for  splitting  the  dataset.  After  that,K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Deep Neural  Network  (DNN),  and  Naive  Bayes  (NB)  classifiers  were applied on both selected datasets using GA and initial dataset (8features) to find out which dataset gives the best results.
